      In javascript, a Set is a collection of unique and ordered elements. Just
      like Set, WeakSet is also a collection of unique and ordered elements with
      some key differences: Weakset contains only objects and no other type. An
      object inside the weakset is referenced weakly. This means, that if the
      object inside the weakset does not have a reference, it will be garbage
      collected. Unlike Set, WeakSet only has three methods, add() , delete()
      and has() .
